# DL-LULC-time
This repository holds the code and data (some of them) from the published paper:
"Deep learning models to map an agricultural expansion area with MODIS and Sentinel-2 time series images"
*The paper used both MODIS and Sentinel-2 MSI data, due to the size of the image, I just have MODIS label data (y) at here. For some of you are interested with the feature data (x), you can process it by yourself.
*The code at here just starts from the perpared image. For some of you are interested with how to process images, you can find the related resources by yourself.
*tif files start with "MCD12Q1.IBGP*" are label data for model training and testing.
*tif files start with "MAP_MCD43A4*" are results that you can use it as an additional data for other geographic problem analysis.
*The h5 files are trained model. For some of you who want to use it as a pre-trained model.

*The code and data shared at here just for studying and I will not take any responsibility for issues you occurred when you are using the code to process your own data.
